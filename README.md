# SQL

Welcome to our SQL question solutions repository!

This repository contains solutions to various SQL questions from different coding platforms like Leetcode, HackerRank, and so on.

Each solution is presented in a separate file, with a clear and well-commented code. The file name includes the question number, name, and the platform name for easy identification.

We have also included the prompt for each question and the expected output in the solution file to make it easy for readers to understand the problem.

Each solution has been optimized for performance and clarity.

We hope that this repository will be a useful resource for anyone who is preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve their SQL skills. If you have any suggestions for improvements or have any questions about the solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for visiting our repository!
